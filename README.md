# Caesars-cipher
Basic Java application that Encrypts message using Caesars Cipher, and JUnit for unit testing. 

Main() found in: Caesars_Cipher/lib/src/main.java

I developed the prototype of this Application following along a youtube tutorial, but intend to add several new functionalities to it over time. My todo list is listed below.

 TO DO:
 * 1.Take user input instead of hardcoded msg
 * 2.Update test case file after you do this
 * 3.Add other test cases

 LONG TERM GOALS:
 * 1.Implement GUI with javaFX 
 * 2.Add a login and landing page to save converted phrases? 
 * 3. Different kinds of cyphers available to user?
